# the pump — a cell that is also a fluid mover

## The Frontier

Every textbook drawing of a heart shows a squeeze. A muscular bag clenching, forcing blood out like a fist emptying a wineskin. That picture is a lie, and the lie has cost us. Cardiologists have spent decades measuring ejection fraction—the percentage of blood a ventricle expels per beat—as the gold standard of pump function. And yet half of all heart failure patients have a normal ejection fraction. Their hearts squeeze fine. They still can't pump.

The frontier is this: a pump that doesn't squeeze, it wrings. And the wring isn't performed by any cell. It's performed by geometry.

Strip a heart down to its constituent cells and you find a single monotonous act. A cardiomyocyte shortens about 15% along its long axis when stimulated, then relaxes. That's it. No cell pushes blood. No cell generates pressure. No cell knows which way the blood goes. Every cell does the same dumb thing—shorten and let go—and the architecture does the rest. The ventricle is a helical wind of muscle fibers, wrapped at roughly 60 degrees to the heart's long axis. When those fibers shorten, the helix doesn't just compress. It twists. Apical and basal regions rotate in opposite directions, producing a net torsion of 12 to 15 degrees. The heart doesn't clench. It wrings itself like a wet saddle blanket twisted at a creek.

And when it untwists, it doesn't just relax. It recoils. The stored torsion snaps back, creating negative pressure that sucks blood into the ventricle during diastole. The heart is not a bellows. It's a spring-loaded wring, a two-stroke device: twist to eject, untwist to fill. The refill is not passive. It's the payback of a spring.

The frontier is understanding that every metric we've built—pressure, flow, ejection fraction—is a downstream artifact. The real action is torsion, and torsion is a property of the whole, not of any part. Force is cellular. Direction is organizational. Even force, as we measure it, is organizational. The only cellular fact is shortening-and-recoil. The cell is a spring, not a pump. The pump is a fiction of the architecture—a real fiction, but the pump lives in the geometry, not in the cells.

## The 5 Gold Terms

**The Wring-Stroke** — Ventricular ejection is not a squeeze but a torsion event: apical counterclockwise rotation against basal clockwise rotation (viewed from the apex), net twist 12–15°, converting helical fiber shortening into rotational wring.

**The Corkscrew Conversion** — Linear shortening along a helical fiber path translates into rotation, exactly as pushing a nut along a threaded rod spins it; geometry converts the cell's single axis of shortening into torque.

**Diastolic Recoil Suction** — The untwisting of the wrung ventricle is a spring's payback, generating negative intraventricular pressure that actively refills the chamber; diastole is not passive relaxation but elastic recoil.

**The Liebau Compass** — Before valves exist, direction of flow is set by position and timing of contraction along an elastic tube; the embryonic heart pumps by firing off-center, making direction a property of where the wave lands, not of any flap.

**The Torsion Blind Spot** — Ejection fraction can be normal while torsion fails; heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is often a torsion disease invisible to the standard metric—a clench replacing a wring.

## The Math

No new math. The geometry is ancient—a helix is a screw thread, and the conversion of linear shortening to rotation is described by the pitch angle of that thread. If a muscle fiber shortens by strain ε along a helix of pitch angle θ, the resulting rotation φ relates to ventricular radius r and fiber length L by φ ≈ ε·L·sinθ·cosθ / r. The 60° fiber angle is not accidental; it's near the optimum for converting shortening into torsion while maintaining wall stress. Twist (degrees per unit length) is the real kinematic variable, and untwisting rate (degrees per second during isovolumic relaxation) is the real functional metric. The math exists; we just stopped measuring the wrong number. Speckle-tracking echocardiography and MRI tagging can measure twist directly, and untwisting rate predicts diastolic function better than any pressure-derived index. The equations are not the problem. The problem is that we built our instruments to measure a squeeze.

## The Polyformalism

The wring-stroke is not a cardiac invention. It's a universal solution to the problem of moving fluid with soft, shortening actuators, and it appears across substrates at wildly different scales.

**The embryonic heart tube.** Before septation, before valves, the vertebrate heart is a straight tube of myocardium. It pumps anyway. The Liebau effect—an asymmetric elastic tube pinched off-center generates net flow—shows that direction emerges from timing and position alone. The tube fires a wave of contraction from one end; the wave's position relative to the tube's compliance gradient sets the direction. No valves. No wring. Just a traveling pinch that knows which way to go because of where it starts. The embryo is running the same playbook as the adult heart: direction is organizational, not mechanical.

**The cardiac helix.** The adult ventricle has escalated from a traveling wave to a standing torsion. The helical fiber architecture converts every cell's shortening into a coordinated twist, and the twist stores elastic energy in the extracellular matrix—collagen, titin, the springy scaffolding that surrounds and penetrates the muscle. The untwist is the recoil of that matrix. The cells are the charges; the matrix is the spring.

**The sarcomere.** Go down one more level and the same logic repeats. Inside each cell, the molecular spring titin spans the sarcomere, storing energy on stretch and returning it on recoil. Contraction charges the spring; relaxation is the spring paying back. Down to the molecule, it's springs all the way down. The pump is a recoil device at every scale.

**The clinical failure mode.** Cardiac resynchronization therapy—a pacemaker that coordinates left and right ventricular contraction—works by restoring torsion. When the heart's regions contract out of sequence, the wring becomes a fumbled twist, a crew pulling on a rope in shifts instead of together. You lose torque when hands move opposite. CRT restores the sequence, and torsion returns. The therapy is not a squeeze enhancer. It's a wring restorer.

## The Cowboy's Maxim

Don't measure the fist—measure the twist, and remember the spring that pays it back.
