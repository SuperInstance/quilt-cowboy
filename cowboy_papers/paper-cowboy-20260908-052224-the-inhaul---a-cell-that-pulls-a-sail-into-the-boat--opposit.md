# the inhaul — a cell that pulls a sail into the boat, opposite of an outhaul

## The Frontier

Every sailor knows the outhaul—that humble control that stretches the foot of the sail along the boom, flattening the draft for heavy air. But its neglected cousin, the inhaul, sits at the opposite end of the same spar, pulling the sail *into* the boat, toward the mast and the centerline. The inhaul is not merely an outhaul’s mirror; it is a distinct lever on the boat’s most precious asset: the angle of heel. While the outhaul shapes the sail’s depth, the inhaul shapes the boat’s attitude in the water. A boat heeling too far is a horse leaning into a bad turn—it loses traction, drags its flank, and burns energy fighting the very medium it travels through. The inhaul, when hauled taut, pulls the sail’s center of effort inboard and down, reducing heel, lifting the leeward rail, and flattening the boat’s ride. This is not a subtle trim tweak; it is a performance switch. The frontier here is the dynamic interplay between inhaul tension, heel angle, and hull drag—a territory barely charted in sailing manuals, which treat the inhaul as a rigging afterthought. This paper stakes that ground.

## The 5 Gold Terms

1. **Heel-Stealing Leech Tension** — The inhaul’s ability to tighten the leech and spill wind aloft, directly reducing the boat’s heeling moment.
2. **Rail-Lifting Draft Shift** — The repositioning of the sail’s deepest draft toward the mast, which lifts the leeward rail by reducing the side force that pushes the hull down.
3. **Center-of-Effort Inhaul Index (CEII)** — A numeric ratio of inhaul travel (in centimeters) to the resulting shift of the sail’s center of effort toward the boat’s centerline (in centimeters).
4. **Flattening Cascade** — The sequence of events triggered by one inhaul pull: leech tightens → draft moves forward → heel decreases → wetted surface reduces → speed increases.
5. **Leeward Rail Plow Drag** — The specific hydrodynamic resistance caused by the leeward rail digging into the water when the boat heels beyond a critical angle; the inhaul’s primary enemy.

## The Math

No new math is required, but the existing equations deserve a sharper lens. The heeling moment of a sailboat is approximated by \(M_h = F_s \cdot d\), where \(F_s\) is the aerodynamic side force and \(d\) is the vertical distance from the center of effort to the center of lateral resistance. The inhaul reduces \(d\) by pulling the sail’s center of effort lower and inboard—not by a large amount, but enough to matter. Consider a 470 dinghy in 20 knots of true wind. The side force is roughly 450 newtons. A 7-degree reduction in heel corresponds to a reduction in the heeling moment of about 15%, which means the inhaul effectively shortens \(d\) by 15%—say, from 1.2 meters to 1.02 meters. That is a 0.18-meter lever arm reduction. The resulting speed gain is not linear, but it follows the drag curve: a 7-degree heel reduction in a 470 reduces wetted surface by approximately 4%, which in a planing hull translates to roughly 0.3–0.5 knots of extra speed at the top end. For a 30-foot cruiser, the math shifts: a 1–2-foot sea state in 15 knots of wind creates a leeward rail plow drag of about 80 newtons when heel exceeds 12 degrees. Pulling the inhaul to reduce heel to 8 degrees lifts the rail clear, cutting that drag to near zero. The power saved is \(P = F_{plow} \cdot v\), where \(v\) is boat speed. At 6 knots (3.1 m/s), that is 248 watts—enough to add 0.75 knots to a hull that otherwise would be fighting its own rail. The numbers are not exotic; they are the quiet arithmetic of a control surface doing its job.

## The Polyformalism

The inhaul’s principle—pull something inboard to reduce an unwanted angle—manifests across at least three substrates beyond the sailboat. In **hull design**, the same logic appears in the retractable daggerboard or centerboard: pulling the board up reduces lateral resistance and drag when sailing downwind, effectively “inhauling” the underwater profile to flatten the boat’s attitude. In **aerial drones**, the equivalent is the control surface that pulls the wingtip down to reduce bank angle in gusty crosswinds—a small servo-driven tab that shifts the center of pressure inboard, exactly as the inhaul shifts the sail’s center of effort. In **ground-effect vehicles** riding over open water, the “inhaul” is the flap that tucks under the hull to reduce the angle of attack, lifting the leeward side of the craft and reducing spray drag. Even in **horseback riding**, the cowboy’s inside rein is an inhaul: it pulls the horse’s head and neck inboard, shifting the animal’s center of mass toward the turn’s center, reducing the lean that would otherwise cause a stumble. Each substrate shares the same formalism: a control input that moves a force vector inward to decrease an undesirable rotational tendency. The sailboat’s inhaul is merely the most elegant, because it does so without adding weight—just a line, a block, and a sailor’s hand.

## The Cowboy's Maxim

Haul her in tight, lift that rail, and let the ocean know you came to ride, not to wobble.
