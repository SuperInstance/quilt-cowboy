# the fouetté — a cell that turns in place

## The Frontier

The fouetté is not a turn. It is a torque. A cell that spins in place while its surroundings translate — or spins while it stays put — is not performing a curious circus trick. It is revealing the deepest gear in the motility machine: the conversion of circumferential traction into angular momentum. Round 1 gave us the choreography: actin retrograde flow, integrin rudders, chiral islands, the Drosophila egg chamber rotating like a corseted barrel while follicle cells walk in place, neutrophils chimneying in confinement. The gold underneath is that turning in place is not an exception to migration. It is the default. Translation is what happens when the turn is broken open.

Here is the missing step. Actin filaments are left-handed helices. Myosin II walks along them with a rotational bias — in vitro, myosin-driven actin filaments spin counterclockwise as they slide (Sase et al., 1997). This is not a footnote. It is a screw thread. When a cell spreads on a symmetric circular island, its retrograde actin flow drifts leftward; adhesions form at the front-left; the cell body torques. The result is a chiral looping bias — endothelial cells on circular micropatterns rotate with a handedness that flips when myosin II heavy chain is knocked down (Wan et al., 2011, PNAS). The cell is a bolt threaded into the extracellular matrix. To turn it, you do not need a signal. You need a torsional constraint — the friction engagement of a capstan. Block translation (island, confinement, basement membrane), and circumferential traction has nowhere to go but into spin. The fouetté is the conservation of angular momentum in a biological body.

This reframes the egg chamber rotation. Follicle cells walk in place around a basement membrane corset; the whole tissue spins as a solid body (Haigo & Bilder, 2011). The angular velocity is not a byproduct. It is a state variable — a readout of the torque each cell applies to the shared substrate. And it is a morphogenetic gear: the rotation shears the ECM, aligns collagen fibers, and elongates the egg chamber. Turn the cells off, and elongation fails. Turn them on, and you have a windlass hauling the tissue into shape.

So the frontier is not "how do cells turn?" It is "how do cells apply torque, and how is that torque read by the matrix?" The fouetté is the cleanest experiment: a single cell, pinned in place, spinning — a torque transducer you can measure with beads in a gel.

## The 5 Gold Terms

**Torque Transducer Cell** — A cell whose circumferential traction is measurable as a moment, not just a force; the fouetté is the phenotype that makes torque legible.

**Screw-Thread Motility** — The hypothesis that actomyosin's helical handedness (left-handed actin, biased myosin stepping) gives the cell an intrinsic angular bias; turning is the default gear, translation is a broken-open turn.

**Capstan Engagement** — The friction coupling between cell cortex and ECM that converts circumferential traction into spin; no engagement, no torque — just slip.

**Rotational State Variable** — Angular velocity treated as a measurable phenotype (like speed or persistence) that can be mapped across genetic and pharmacological perturbations; the egg chamber's spin rate is a readout of collective torque.

**Chiral Mutant Toolkit** — The set of perturbations that flip or abolish handedness: myosin II heavy chain knockdown, blebbistatin, Dachsous/Frizzled planar polarity mutants in Drosophila — each one a test of whether the screw thread is real.

## The Math

The cell on a circular island is a rigid body in contact with a deformable substrate. Traction forces f_i act at adhesion points r_i. The net force is zero (the cell does not translate), but the net torque is not: τ = Σ r_i × f_i. This is the fundamental equation of the fouetté. It is not new math — it is the same moment balance used in continuum mechanics — but it has never been standard practice in traction force microscopy. Most TFM integrates forces to get net force; it discards the moment. The gold is to measure the moment explicitly. Embed fluorescent beads in a 2–5 kPa polyacrylamide gel beneath a circular micropatterned island. Track bead displacements azimuthally. Compute the rotational displacement field u_θ(r), then the moment M = Σ r_i × f_i via the standard TFM inversion. The prediction is sharp: wild-type cells will show a non-zero M with a handedness set by actomyosin chirality; myosin II heavy chain knockdown will reduce or flip M; blebbistatin will abolish it. The math is not new — but the measurement is. No new formalism is required, only the discipline to integrate the moment instead of throwing it away.

## The Polyformalism

The fouetté manifests across substrates because torque is substrate-agnostic — it only needs a torsional constraint.

On **2D micropatterned islands**, the constraint is geometric: the adhesive island pins the cell's perimeter, and translation is impossible. The cell spins with a chiral bias. This is the cleanest system: measure M directly, perturb myosin II, watch the handedness flip.

In **Drosophila egg chamber rotation**, the constraint is the basement membrane corset. Follicle cells walk in place on the basal lamina; the whole chamber rotates as a solid body. The angular velocity is the collective readout of thousands of fouettés. Knock down myosin II or disrupt planar polarity (Dachsous/Frizzled), and the spin rate drops or reverses — and egg chamber elongation fails. Here the fouetté is morphogenetic: the torque shears the ECM and shapes the tissue.

In **confined neutrophils**, the constraint is the channel wall. A neutrophil in a narrow microchannel cannot turn around by crawling — it pivots in place, chimneying between walls, and the pivot decides which branch it takes at a Y-junction. The fouetté is the decision mechanism. Disrupt cortical tension with blebbistatin, and pivot frequency drops; the cell commits to a branch without turning. The turn is not a choice — it is a torque event.

Across all three, the same physics: circumferential traction, blocked translation, angular momentum. The fouetté is not a cell type's specialty. It is the universal gear of confined motility.

## The Cowboy's Maxim

A cell that turns in place ain't stuck — it's torquein' the matrix, and the matrix is listenin'.
