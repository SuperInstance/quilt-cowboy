# the turret — a cell that is also a small tower

## The Frontier

The primary cilium is not a receptor. It is a gun. A cell that grows a small tower from its centriole is not listening — it is aiming. The barrel is the axoneme, nine doublet microtubules braced by dynein arms that do not slide in most cilia but instead hold the whole assembly under torsion like a loaded spring. The trigger is the deflection: flow, pressure, or ligand binding bends the barrel, opens mechanosensitive channels at the base or tip, and fires a calcium shot into the cytoplasm.

But a gun that fires identically every time is a bad gun. A seasoned marine knows his rifle: after enough rounds, the action loosens, the bore fouls, the trigger pull changes. The cell knows this too. Round 2 of the writers' room established that the axoneme logs its shots as post-translational marks — tubulin acetylation at K40, detyrosination at the C-terminal tail — and that these marks alter the barrel's stiffness. The paired-pulse protocol was proposed: deflect twice, measure the calcium ratio, watch the second shot come back weaker or stronger depending on the barrel's history.

Round 3's job is to find what sits underneath that ratchet. The marks are on the barrel, but the barrel does not talk to the ion channel directly. Something reads the marks. Something turns chemistry into conductance. And something decides whether the second shot is a whisper or a thunderclap. The frontier is not the mark — it is the reader, the ink, and the sign of the loop.

## The 5 Gold Terms

**The Muzzle-Loaded Kymograph** — IFT trains (kinesin-II anterograde, dynein-2 retrograde) that ride the acetylated barrel faster, delivering polycystin-2 (PC2) and TRPV4 channels to the tip. The kymograph is not just a measurement — it is the ammo elevator. Acetylation speeds the elevator; the elevator changes the shot size.

**The Flash-Loaded Pencil** — The calcium transient from shot 1 is not the memory. It is the ink. The flash of the muzzle loads the pencil: Ca2+ entry activates local calmodulin/calcineurin signaling that modulates αTAT1 (the acetyltransferase) or inhibits HDAC6 (the eraser), writing the mark after the shot has already been fired.

**The One-Handle Eraser** — HDAC6 does double duty: it deacetylates the axoneme and drives ciliary resorption before mitosis. The same molecule that wipes the shot counter dismounts the turret. Memory erasure and unlimbering are one physical act.

**The Opposed-Prediction Fork** — Acetylation stiffens the barrel (smaller deflection per unit force → smaller shot) but also speeds IFT (more channels at tip → bigger shot). Two mechanisms, opposite signs. The fork is where the experiment lives.

**The Seasoned-Gun Paradox** — Flow-adapted kidney cells (MDCK, LLC-PK1) hyperacetylate their cilia and show reduced calcium sensitivity per unit deflection — the seasoned gun flinches less. But hyperacetylation also boosts IFT delivery of PC2, which should sensitize. The paradox is resolved only by decoupling stiffness from trafficking.

## The Math

No new math. The existing framework is sufficient, and adding equations would be padding. What the field needs is not a new formula but a new variable: the coupling constant between acetylation state and IFT speed. Known literature gives kinesin-1 a 2–3 fold processivity increase on acetylated microtubules (Reed et al., 2006, in axons). If the same holds for kinesin-II in cilia, then a hyperacetylated barrel delivers channels at roughly double the rate. The paired-pulse ratio, R = Ca2+_shot2 / Ca2+_shot1, is a function of two competing terms: R_stiff (≤1, from reduced deflection) and R_traffic (≥1, from increased channel delivery). The net R is the product. The math is not the problem — the problem is that nobody has measured both terms in the same cilium. That is an experimental design issue, not a mathematical one.

## The Polyformalism

The same ratchet logic appears across at least three substrates.

**Microtubules.** Tubulin acetylation at K40 marks long-lived microtubules. In the cilium, this is the barrel's shot counter. The reader is kinesin-II: acetylated tracks increase motor processivity, changing delivery rates of cargo. The eraser is HDAC6, which also triggers resorption. This is the canonical system.

**Actin.** Stress fibers in endothelial cells align with flow direction over hours. The mechanism is not PTM-based but architectural: cofilin severs weakly-bundled filaments, formin nucleates new ones along the flow axis. The memory is the bundle orientation itself. The eraser is not a single enzyme but a mechanical threshold — when flow reverses, the old bundles are below the critical strain rate for cofilin and get dismantled. Same ratchet logic: write by strain, read by stiffness, erase by catastrophe.

**Chromatin.** Histone acetylation at H3K9 and H4K16 marks active enhancers. The reader is bromodomain-containing proteins (BRD4), which recruit RNA polymerase II. The eraser is HDAC1/2, which also compacts chromatin during mitosis. The parallel to HDAC6 is striking: the same enzyme family that wipes ciliary marks also wipes transcriptional memory during cell division. One handle, many turrets.

**Extracellular matrix.** Fibroblasts under cyclic stretch deposit collagen along the principal strain axis. The memory is the collagen fiber orientation. The reader is the integrin complex — cells sense the stiffness of their own deposited matrix and adjust traction forces accordingly. The eraser is MMP-1, which degrades collagen when strain drops below a threshold. The ratchet is everywhere.

## The Cowboy's Maxim

The experiment that matters: take flow-adapted MDCK cells, deflect the cilium twice with an optical trap (500 nm displacement, 100 ms pulse, 5 s inter-pulse interval), and measure GCaMP6f calcium fluorescence. Then split the cells into four arms: (1) αTAT1 overexpression (hyperacetylation), (2) HDAC6 inhibition with tubastatin A (hyperacetylation, but also blocked resorption), (3) katanin p60 knockdown (stiffer barrel via reduced severing, no acetylation change), and (4) IFT88 knockdown (reduced trafficking, no stiffness change). Measure paired-pulse ratio R, IFT speed by kymograph of IFT88-GFP, and PC2 copy number at the tip by TIRF.

The prediction is not a single number — it is a fork. If R correlates with stiffness (arms 1, 2, and 3 all show R < 1), then the ratchet is mechanical. If R correlates with IFT speed (arms 1 and 2 show R > 1 despite stiffness, arm 4 shows R < 1 despite normal stiffness), then the ratchet is trafficking-dominated. If arm 2 (HDAC6 inhibited) shows a third behavior — no hysteresis at all, R = 1 — then the eraser is required for the ratchet to reset, and the memory is not in the barrel alone but in the balance of writer and eraser.

The deeper test: load shot 1, then immediately buffer ciliary calcium with BAPTA-AM before shot 2. If R returns to 1, the calcium flash from shot 1 was the ink — no flash, no mark, no memory. The ratchet becomes a spring. That is the missing step: the flash loads the pencil.

A cowboy's gun does not remember the shot — it remembers the powder. The barrel is just the place the powder burned. Your cilium is the same: the calcium is the powder, the PTM is the scorch, and the next shot is already different before the barrel cools.
