# the speed — a cell that is also a distance rate

## The Frontier

Out here, every speed is a corpse ratio. You measure how fast you're moving by counting the things you leave behind—knots in a rope, cells in a grid, dead reckoning in the log. The unit of motion is named after the thing that stands still. The knot doesn't move; the rope drags through the water like a dropped anchor. The ship surrenders the rope's length, and the sailor counts the surrendered knots against a 28-second glass. Nothing in that measurement moves except the reference frame. The log line is stationary; the ocean is stationary; the sand in the glass is stationary. The only thing that moves is the ship, and you never measure the ship directly. You count the static world it passes.

Round 1 found the cellular automata speed of light: c = 1 cell per generation. Round 2 found the knot: engineering units so division vanishes into counting. The gold under that gold is this: speed is the price of identity. A single lit cell propagates at c because it carries nothing. A glider carries a shape, so it pays four generations to rebuild itself one cell over. A ship carries cargo, so it pays. The clipper ships ran out of rope—a 15-knot ship in 28 seconds pulls over 70 feet of line, near the end of the standard reel. So sailors shortened the glass to 14 seconds and halved the count. The tick was tuned to the counter, not the physics. Human counting bandwidth set the spec: about one to two knots per second, memory span of seven. The unit is a negotiation between the world's speed and the counter's bandwidth.

The frontier is this: every system has a rebuild time. Your speed is your reconstruction period inverted. To go faster, don't push harder—shrink the rebuild. Compression of the reproduction cycle is the only speed. The herd moves at the rate the front is replaced. The fleet moves at the rate the hull is caulked. The glider moves at the rate it can copy itself one cell over. The light cone is the shape of the possible, and inside that diamond, every pattern pays its own toll.

## The 5 Gold Terms

**Rebuild tax** — The period a pattern must pay to reproduce itself one unit over; speed equals one over this period. A raw bit pays one generation. A glider pays four. A ship pays whatever its cargo demands.

**Corpse ratio** — Any speed measurement is a count of static markers surrendered per tick of a static clock. The knot is the corpse ratio of the sea: dead rope, dead sand, moving ship.

**The 28-second spec** — The human counting bandwidth (1–2 per second, memory span ~7) set the glass length. The tick is tuned to the counter, not the physics. Faster ships got shorter glasses: 14 seconds for clippers, count halved.

**Taxicab tomorrow** — The light cone in a grid is a diamond, not a circle. Diagonal steps cost two generations. The reachable set after n generations is all cells within Manhattan distance n: exactly 2n² + 2n + 1 cells. That diamond is the shape of the possible.

**Patternless maximum** — c = 1 belongs only to what carries nothing. Every bit of structure you preserve is a tax on velocity. Emptiness moves fastest. Light travels light.

## The Math

In a discrete universe with c = 1 cell per generation, the light cone after n generations is the set of cells reachable by Manhattan distance ≤ n. Count them: the diamond has n cells along each axis in each quadrant, plus the center. The count is 2n² + 2n + 1. A glider in Conway's Life moves diagonally at c/4 because it must preserve a 5-cell pattern across four generations: it shifts one cell diagonally, which in Manhattan distance is two cells, over four generations—so its effective speed is 2/4 = 1/2 along the diagonal, or c/4 in Euclidean terms. The general law: for any pattern with period p that translates by d cells per cycle, speed = d/p. To maximize speed, minimize p for a given d. The single cell has d = 1, p = 1, speed = 1. The glider has d = 1 (diagonal, Manhattan 2), p = 4, speed = 1/2 in Manhattan, 1/4 Euclidean. The knot: a ship moving at v knots surrenders v knots of rope per 28 seconds. The rope's knots are spaced at 47.25 feet (one nautical mile per hour over 28 seconds: 6080 feet / 3600 seconds × 28 seconds ≈ 47.25 feet). No division anywhere—just counting marks against a fixed tick.

## The Polyformalism

The same law manifests across substrates. In Conway's Life, the raw bit moves at c; the glider pays 4; the spaceship pays 4 for orthogonal motion; nothing heavier exists because the rule set won't preserve more complex patterns at higher speed. In the ocean, the log line's knots are the cells; the 28-second glass is the generation; the ship's speed is the count of cells surrendered per tick. A clipper at 14 knots needed a 14-second glass to keep the count in human bandwidth—halve the tick, double the rate per tick, keep the arithmetic countable. In a packet-switched network, a raw bit moves at one hop per tick (cut-through routing); a packet with headers, checksums, and reassembly logic pays a rebuild tax at every node—store-and-forward is the glider's four-generation pause. The TCP congestion window is the cargo; the round-trip time is the rebuild period. Speed = window size divided by RTT, and you cannot beat one hop per tick—you can only shrink the rebuild. In a herd of cattle, the front animal moves at its own pace; the herd's effective speed is the rate at which the rear replaces the front—the rebuild tax of the collective. The cowboy's cut is the glass; the herd's drift is the rope.

## The Cowboy's Maxim

You ain't faster than the light, and you ain't faster than your own rebuild—so lighten the cargo or shorten the glass.
