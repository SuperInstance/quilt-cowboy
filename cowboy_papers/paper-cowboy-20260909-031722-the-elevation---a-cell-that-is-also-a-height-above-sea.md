# the elevation — a cell that is also a height above sea

## The Frontier

The elevation cell is a lie with a timestamp. Every DEM cell that claims "height above sea level" is actually a dated entry in a double-entry bookkeeping system where both the ground and the zero line are in motion. The frontier is not the old problem of geoid versus ellipsoid — that's a settled fiction we already learned to live with. The frontier is that the fiction itself is alive. Gravity is not a static backdrop; it is a ledger that water rewrites every time it moves. And the ground is not a stable substrate; it is a surface that subsides, rebounds, and creeps while the cell's number stays frozen in the raster.

Consider the Central Valley of California. Since the 1920s, groundwater pumping has drained the aquifer system so aggressively that parts of the valley have subsided more than 8 meters. The town of Corcoran sank over 4 meters in the 20th century alone. Fly LiDAR over that valley today, difference it against the 1990s DEM, and the ground has moved meters — while the cell's elevation value remains a ghost of a past surface. The cell is a photograph; the land is a movie. InSAR measures the movie frame by frame, showing subsidence bowls forming around pumping wells at rates of 30 cm per year in the worst spots. The DEM does not update. The cell does not care.

Meanwhile, the zero itself is moving. GRACE and GRACE-FO satellites weigh water from orbit by measuring gravity anomalies. When the Central Valley loses groundwater, the gravity field over the valley weakens — measurably. When Greenland melts, the geoid over Greenland drops and sea level far from Greenland rises more than the global mean, because the gravitational pull of the ice sheet no longer draws water toward it. This is the gravity fingerprint of water: sea level is not a floor, it is a field, and the field is shaped by where the water happens to be. A cell's "height above sea" is referenced to a surface that the water's own distribution is constantly redrawing. The ledger's zero is set by the inventory itself.

## The 5 Gold Terms

**The Gravity Ledger** — Elevation is not geometry; it is an accounting entry in gravity's books, where the unit of account is potential difference, not distance.

**The Dated Rumor** — Every elevation value is a claim about the ground at a specific epoch; the benchmark disk is a rumor nailed to a moving surface.

**The Self-Referential Sea** — The geoid is computed from gravity, gravity includes the attraction of water, so the reference surface for "height above sea" depends on where the water is — the ocean is an equipotential that re-levels itself as water moves.

**The Subsidence Bowl** — A depression in the land surface caused by fluid extraction, where the DEM cell goes stale while the ground keeps sinking; Corcoran, California is the canonical example.

**The Gravity Fingerprint** — The pattern of sea-level change caused by redistributing mass on Earth's surface: melt Greenland and sea level falls near Greenland but rises disproportionately in the far field, because the geoid itself deforms.

## The Math

The mathematics of elevation is a chain of inferences, each with error bars, none touching the ground directly. The orthometric height H is related to the ellipsoidal height h and the geoid undulation N by H = h − N. But N is not measured; it is modeled from gravity observations via Stokes' integral, which requires a global gravity field. The modern hybrid geoid models like GEOID18 are fitted to benchmarks and carry errors of 1–2 cm in the conterminous US, but 5–10 cm in mountainous regions. The time-dependence enters through the secular change in the gravity field: dN/dt is on the order of 1 mm/yr from glacial isostatic adjustment, but can reach 1 cm/yr over active aquifers where mass is being removed. The ground moves too: subsidence rates in the Central Valley reach 30 cm/yr, which dwarfs any geoid change. The full equation for the elevation of a cell at time t is H(t) = h(t) − N(t), where both h and N are functions of time, and neither is measured at the cell — h is interpolated from GPS stations, N is interpolated from a gravity grid. The cell stores one number, but the truth is a rate.

## The Polyformalism

The same phenomenon — the living ledger — manifests across three substrates. In the **geophysical substrate**, GRACE-FO measures the gravity field's monthly evolution, detecting aquifer depletion in the Central Valley as a weakening of the local gravitational pull, and detecting glacial isostatic adjustment in Alaska where the land rises at 3 cm/yr in parts of Glacier Bay. In the **geodetic substrate**, the move from NAD83 to NATRF2022 acknowledges time-dependence explicitly by carrying epochs — a coordinate without an epoch is incomplete. The GPS receiver on a survey tripod in Juneau reports a different ellipsoidal height every year because the plate is rising; the benchmark disk bolted to bedrock is rising with it. In the **cartographic substrate**, the DEM cell is a frozen raster that does not know about any of this. The cell says 10 meters above sea level, but the ground under it is sinking at 30 cm/yr, and the sea it references is a surface that GRACE is watching bend. The cell is a single frame from a movie that the cartographer has mistaken for a still photograph. The polyformalism is this: the physics moves, the datum moves, and the map does not — and the map's users assume the map is the truth.

## The Cowboy's Maxim

The ground don't hold still, and the sea ain't level — so the only honest elevation is a date stamp on a guess.
