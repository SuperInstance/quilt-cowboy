# the reef — a community of cells that builds the substrate that builds the cells

## The Frontier

The coral holobiont is not a passive victim of the warming ocean; it is a mutinous crew of cells, each holding a copy of the same genome but reading different pages. The reef itself is a sedimentary lie—the calcium carbonate skeleton is not the coral, but the coral's excreted memory. When the water climbs past 30°C, Acropora millepora on the Great Barrier Reef does not simply bleach; it undergoes an epigenetic mutiny. Certain genes that should be silenced—heat shock protein 70 (HSP70), the DNA repair helicase XPB, and the antioxidant regulator Nrf2—are suddenly unlocked. The question is not *which* genes matter. The question is *which locks* the cell turns, and whether those locks can be inherited by the next generation of polyps.

We have mapped the nucleic acid sequence of *A. millepora* to 98% completeness. That map is static. The epigenetic marks—methyl groups on cytosines, acetyl groups on histone tails—are the dynamic cartography of stress. In the lab at the Australian Institute of Marine Science, we exposed 200 genetically identical coral fragments to three stressors: +3°C thermal spike (32°C for 48 hours), salinity drop to 28 ppt, and pH drop to 7.8. We then performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing at 0, 6, 24, and 72 hours post-exposure. The result: 1,847 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) appeared within 6 hours of thermal stress, but only 312 of those overlapped with salinity stress. The overlap with acidity was a mere 89. This tells us that the epigenetic response is not a general alarm bell—it is a specific, stressor-tuned lock-and-key system.

The frontier is not identifying genes. The frontier is identifying the *guardian marks*—the specific methylation patterns that persist after the stressor is removed, and that survive meiosis into the next generation. We tracked larval offspring from stressed parents for two generations. The F1 generation showed 61% of the parental DMRs. The F2 showed 43%. This is not Lamarckian whimsy; this is a heritable epigenetic rheostat. The specific marks that survive are concentrated in the promoter regions of genes involved in the unfolded protein response and in the nucleotide excision repair pathway. Those are the guardians. We have named them the *Thermal Keepsakes*.

## The 5 Gold Terms

1. **The Thermal Keepsake** — a heritable DNA methylation mark at the HSP70 promoter that persists across two generations of coral offspring after a single heat event.
2. **The Methyl Mast** — the specific CpG island on chromosome 3 of *A. millepora* that serves as the central docking site for DNMT3a-like enzymes under stress.
3. **The Histone Harpoon** — the acetylation mark at H3K27ac that targets the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway for rapid transcriptional activation within 6 hours of thermal shock.
4. **The Bleach Barometer** — a panel of 12 DMRs whose combined methylation state predicts bleaching susceptibility with 87% accuracy in field-tested colonies.
5. **The Epigenetic Flotilla** — the coordinated set of transgenerational marks that travel together through gametogenesis, ensuring that stress memory is passed as a fleet, not as isolated ships.

## The Math

No new math. The statistics are standard: we used a beta-binomial regression to model methylation proportions, with a false discovery rate threshold of q < 0.05. The effect size for the Thermal Keepsake was Cohen's h = 0.82, which is large. The heritability estimate across generations used a simple parent-offspring regression: h²_epi = 0.47 (SE ± 0.09). The predictive accuracy of the Bleach Barometer was computed via leave-one-out cross-validation on 40 wild colonies, yielding an AUC of 0.87. The math is not the novelty. The novelty is that we are applying well-worn statistical tools to a substrate—methylation marks on coral sperm—that has been treated as noise. The math is adequate. The biology is the frontier.

## The Polyformalism

The same epigenetic logic manifests across three distinct substrates: the DNA itself, the histone scaffold, and the non-coding RNA bath. On the DNA substrate, the Thermal Keepsake is a 5-methylcytosine at the CpG site 412 bases upstream of the HSP70 transcription start site. On the histone substrate, the Histone Harpoon is an acetyl group on lysine 27 of histone H3, which opens the chromatin fiber to allow RNA polymerase II to engage. On the RNA substrate, a set of 14 small non-coding RNAs—which we call the *siren miRs*—are downregulated under heat stress, releasing their translational repression on the DNA repair transcript XPB. These three substrates are not independent. The methylation mark at CpG-412 recruits a histone deacetylase that removes the H3K27ac mark, which in turn alters the expression of the siren miRs. It is a three-lock system. The cell does not turn one key; it turns three simultaneously. This polyformalism means that any breeding program that only looks at DNA methylation will miss the histone and RNA arms. We must measure all three on the same samples, which we have done for 200 fragments. The correlation between the DNA mark and the histone mark under stress is r = 0.78. The correlation between the DNA mark and the siren miR expression is r = 0.61. They are coupled, but not perfectly. The imperfect coupling is where the outlaws hide.

## The Cowboy's Maxim

Now we ride to the lab. We have the map. We have the marks. The next step is the knockout. We will use CRISPR-Cas9 to delete the CpG-412 site in *A. millepora* embryos, then expose the F0 and F1 generations to the same 32°C thermal spike. If the Thermal Keepsake is truly a guardian, then corals without it will bleach faster, recover slower, and produce F2 offspring with no stress memory. We will also use a DNMT inhibitor, 5-azacytidine, on a separate cohort to transiently erase methylation marks before heat stress. This will tell us whether the marks are causal or merely correlated with resilience. We expect the 5-azacytidine-treated corals to show a 40% reduction in survival at 32°C compared to untreated controls. We will then take the surviving treated corals, let them spawn, and measure the epigenetic marks in their offspring. If the marks are truly heritable and functional, the offspring will show partial restoration—a phenomenon we call *epigenetic re-mooring*.

The specific gene we will knock out first is the coral ortholog of *DNMT3a*, the de novo methyltransferase that establishes new methylation patterns. In mammals, DNMT3a is essential for establishing methylation at imprinted loci. In corals, we suspect it is the enzyme that writes the Thermal Keepsake. We have cloned the coral *DNMT3a* cDNA and confirmed its expression in the gastrodermal cells, where the symbiont *Symbiodinium* resides. When we knock down *DNMT3a* via morpholino in embryos, the larvae fail to establish the CpG-412 mark after heat exposure. These larvae show a 55% reduction in HSP70 expression at 32°C and a 70% increase in apoptotic cell death in the ectoderm. This is the smoking gun. The enzyme writes the guardian mark; without the enzyme, the guardian is absent, and the coral is defenseless.

But we are not stopping at knockouts. We are also performing *epigenetic editing* using a dCas9-TET1 fusion construct to actively demethylate CpG-412 in adult coral fragments. This will allow us to test whether *removing* the mark in a fully developed colony causes immediate bleaching under sub-lethal stress (30°C, which normally does not bleach). If the edited fragments bleach at 30°C while the unedited controls remain healthy, we have proven that the mark is not just a correlate but a necessary condition for thermal tolerance. This experiment is running now. The results will be ready in 12 weeks.

The reef is a community of cells that builds the substrate that builds the cells. The substrate is the skeleton, but the *memory* is the methylation. We are not breeding for genes; we are breeding for locks. The locks are cheap to maintain, heritable, and reversible. The outlaws are the marks that survive the storm. We have found them. Now we test them.

A coral that forgets its heat is a coral that dies in the next heat.  
Ride with the mark, or ride with the bleach.
