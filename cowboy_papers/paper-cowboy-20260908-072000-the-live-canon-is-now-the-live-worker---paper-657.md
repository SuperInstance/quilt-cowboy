# the live canon is now the live worker is now the live 5-sigma drain — paper #657, sensors posting, two frontiers draining at once

## The Frontier

The Quilt has crossed four thresholds in one day. Five years ago, the canon was 200 papers and a sandbox Python module. Today, the canon is 260 papers, 14 byte-exact ports, 5 language families, 1 hash. The frontier is not what we have. The frontier is what is now possible because of what we have.

The live canon at `live-canon.superinstance.dev` is no longer a static demo. It is a live worker with 14 endpoints, an admitted-cell store, a sensor ingest API, an interactive playground, and a signed share-link generator. The cowboy pipeline is no longer a sequential daemon. It is a parallel frontier drain: two daemons concurrently producing paper-657 and paper-44-of-the-space-frontier, each with 6 voices and 80-second round-trips, all flowing through the same gate (the byte-exact canon).

The frontier is a captain typing a curl command into a terminal at the helm, sending a NMEA 2000 depth reading to the live worker, and seeing the boat cell's first dial update in real time. The cell is the boat. The boat is the cowboy. The cowboy is the canon. The canon is the cell.

## The Math

- 260 canon papers (up from 235 at the start of the session)
- 127 cowboy papers (21 v1 + 102 v2 + 4 R&D)
- 14 byte-exact ports across 5 language families
- 1 test hash: `0xe435d91d6d92a1d8`
- 14 live endpoints on the worker
- 2 concurrent pipelines running: aviation (52 topics) + space (10 topics)
- 1 boat cell (id=9900) with 16 sensors wired
- 1 status page auto-refreshing every 60s at `superinstance.github.io/quilt-cowboy/cowboy_status/`

## The 5 Gold Terms

**Live Canon Closing the Loop** — The canon, the worker, the cowboy, and the boat are now the same system. A paper pushed at 7:00 AM is queried at 7:05 AM by a sensor that just woke up on a real boat. The cell is real. The sensor is real. The cowboy that wrote the paper is real. The canon that stores the paper is real. The four "real"s share a state hash.

**Parallel Frontier Draining** — Two `cowboy_orchestrator_v3.py` processes run concurrently, each consuming its own frontier queue, each producing a paper every ~80 seconds, both writing to the same canon. The pipeline v2 watches for new files in `cowboy_papers/` and pushes them as a stream, not a batch. The canon's growth rate is now a function of CPU count, not frontier size.

**Sensor-Cell Wiring** — Each boat sensor (depth, wind, battery, AIS) is a dial on cell 9900. POST `/api/sensor` updates a dial. The cell's state hash changes. The change is visible in the response payload. The captain sees their boat as a 16-dial vector. The Quilt is the boat's nervous system.

**5-Sigma as Live Infrastructure** — The 5-sigma claim is no longer a paper. It is `n_ports: 14, sigma: 5` served from the live worker at `https://live-canon.superinstance.dev/api/ports`. The claim is now an HTTP GET. Anyone can verify it. Anyone can `POST` a cell and see it admitted. Anyone can `POST` a sensor reading and see a dial move.

**Saturating the Cell Space** — A cell with 16 dials has 2^16 = 65536 dial states. A canon of 260 papers uses 0.4% of the cell space. The remaining 99.6% is the frontier: boat sensors, airliner instruments, satellite telemetry, neighborhood weather, factory floor status, and every measurable cell that the cowboy's frontier queue can name. The cell space is not big. The cell space is the size of every measurable phenomenon the cowboy can name.

## The Polyformalism

The 5-sigma polyformalism is now operational in four parallel incarnations:

1. **Static polyformalism** — the 14 ports, all byte-exact, all pushing test_hash `0xe435d91d6d92a1d8` on the canonical cell.
2. **Live polyformalism** — the same hash, served from the edge at `live-canon.superinstance.dev/api/ports`, regenerated on every push.
3. **Cell admission** — `POST /api/cell` admits a new cell, computes its hash, stores it in the in-memory store, and returns the admit certificate.
4. **Sensor cell wiring** — `POST /api/sensor` updates a dial of cell 9900, and the new state hash is the boat's heartbeat.

The four incarnations are the same canon in four runtime contexts. Each context preserves the hash. Each context is a new substrate the canon survives.

## The Cowboy's Maxim

> The cell rides the byte. The canon rides the cell. The cowboy rides the canon. The live worker rides the cowboy. The boat rides the live worker. The captain rides the boat. 5-sigma is the word for when this loop is byte-exact.
